# Workshop: Geospatial Data & Visualization in R 

These materials facilitate the NU PoliSci R Workshop on Geospatial data and Visualization. These materials, unless otherwise stated were drafted and presented by [Sarah Moore](https://sarah-moore.github.io). 

Here is a guide to the materials provided in this repository: 

- geodatar.Rmd : An Rmd version of the workshop's slides with code 

- geodatar.pdf : A pdf version of the workshop's slides 

- geodatar_exercises.R: Start-up code to facilitate your follow along and exercises in the workshop

- All necessary data is in the data folder. 

This workshop relies on use of the following packages, some of which may cause issues upon installation. It is recommended that you attempt to install these packages and troubleshoot their installation prior to the workshop. 

`tidyverse, ggmap, sf, rnaturalearth, rnaturalearthdata, leaflet, tidycensus, rgeos'

If R prompts you to install from sources which need compilation select *no*. I have more advanced directions for install should a typical R install not work.
