# Geographic Data? Geospatial Data? 

- Data that refer to and encode geographic locations into the datapoints. 

- Ideally, each unit of analysis in geographic data would then have some geographic attributes attached to each observation.  

  - For example, if we have a geographic dataset of every municipality in Illinois, we'd then expect that every municipality datapoint has associated geographic information of some form (e.g. latitude and longitude coordinates, zip codes, etc. ). 

- You might hear the term *geospatial data* instead, this is the same thing maybe just fancier sounding. 

## ... GIS? 

- The term GIS is a more specific reference to Geographic Information Systems. 

- GIS and geospatial/geographic data *are not* interchangeable terms. 
---
# Types of Geospatial Data

- Vector: a series of points, lines, and polygons that represent a geographical feature or object
  - Good for representing discrete boundaries (school districts, electoral districts, neighborhoods and subdivisions)


- Raster: a series of grids with information based on satellite and other sensing techniques 
  - Probably unlikely in the social sciences; useful for continuous data though we can still achieve this to an extent with vector data. 

---
# Types of Encoding 

- Popular means of encoding standardized geographic information are familiar: 
  
  - Addresses (e.g. 601 University Pl, Evanston, IL)
  
  - Zip Codes (e.g. 60208, 60625, 88130)

- Others are less familiar, or maybe used less day-to-day: 

  - FIPS Codes for counties in the US 
  
  - Census tracts  

  - Coordinate Referencing System
  
---

# Coordinate Referencing System (CRS)

- In most cases the referencing system you will use is a <i> geographic coordinate system </i>, expressed as longitude and latitude. 

- Basic familiarity and orientation on how these coordinates are transcribed is necessary.

- There are other CRS, which can make it tricky, but we'll go over the basics here. The other potential CRS are unlikely encounters for social science.<sup>1</sup>

# Translating/Transcribing Coordinates

- Typically, when you look up a location's coordinates you'll get something like: 41.8766° N, 87.6384° W (The Old Post Office, Chicago, IL)

- However, we have to change how we think about this a little for coding purposes. 

- Instead of thinking in N/S and E/W we have to translate into +/- across the equator and +/- across the prime meridian, respectively. 

  - So (41.8766° N, 87.6384° W) &rarr; (41.8766°, -87.6384°) 
---
# Lat, Long Exercise 

- Try this on a few more coordinates: 
  - 30.3285° N, 35.4444° E (Petra, Jordan)
  
  - 33.8568° S, 151.2153° E (Sydney Opera House)
  
  - 50.4967° S, 73.1377° W (Perito Moreno Glacier, Argentina)

# Beyond the built-in

It's unlikely that you will only ever want some geospatial data that is already built into a package in R. However, if you know you are dealing with some sort of administrative boundaries, it's always good to check if there is an existing package. For example, ACS data is easily pulled from existing packages in R. 

Otherwise, it's necessary to find data files that contain the relevant information to create map plots. 

- Most often you will encounter shapefiles (.shp). Even just querying something about your topic of interest plus "shape file" will get you a file with geospatial data that you can then import and use in R. 

- Let's check out what happens when we download a shapefile of the <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-School-Locations-SY1718/4g38-vs8v">Chicago School Districts.</a>

  - When you download, you'll see that your file downloads as a .zip file with a bunch of other files. THESE ARE IMPORTANT! These are file dependencies that the .shp file requires to load so wherever you move the .shp file, these have to go along with it.

# Anatomy of a ShapeFile 

```{r include = T, eval= T, message=F}
chicago_schools <- st_read("data/school/chicago-schools.shp", quiet = T)

chicago_schools %>%
  select(c(12,1,8,9,14:16))-> small_chicago
kableExtra::kbl(small_chicago[1:5,], full_width = F)
```

---
# ShapeFile Geometry Matters 

.pull-left[
```{r eval =  T, message=T, fig.align = "center"}
ggplot(data = chicago_schools)+ 
  geom_sf() + 
    theme(
     axis.text = element_blank(),

# Adding Layers 

Since the last mapping only included the points, let's also figure out a way to add in the boundaries of Chicago. First, we have to load in another relevant shapefile. 

Let's check out this shapefile, what is the geometry of these datapoints?

# Exercise: ~10 min. 

0. Install and load all of the packages on to your local machine. (Hint: Start out with the R script title "geodatar_exercises.R")

1. Import the Chicago Park District shapefile in the data subfolder "parks." 

2. Create a layered map of (1) Chicago city wards in white with (2) Chicago parks in dark green. 

3. Using some dplyr skills, as well as `st_join()` from the `sf` package, (1) count the number of parks per ward OR (2) sum the total acres of park space per ward and (3) fill in the ward with a gradient green based on the mutated variable that you created.

- Prior to using the `st_join()` function, you will probably have to use this code to override some settings: `sf_use_s2(FALSE)`

# Exercise Code, Step 1 & 2

```{r include = T, eval= F, message=F}

     panel.background = element_blank(),
     axis.ticks = element_blank(),
  ) + 
  labs(title = "Chicago Park Disricts")->chicago_park_map

sf_use_s2(FALSE)
st_join(chicago_wards, chicago_parks, largest= T) -> chicago_ward_parks

# But what about different sources?

- Up until now, we have used data coming from the same source. This allows us to assume that we are dealing with similar projections and thus similiarly referenced coordinates. 

- But, this is not always the case. Sometimes some data may be projected in Mercator, whereas another file that you need is projected in WGS84. Figuring out what projection you are working in between files is important. Mainly for analysis.

- `ggplot` is nice to us and reprojects all of our mapped objects into the same CRS anyway :). But here are some tips for checking to see if you're geodata are all in the same projection. 

- In the event that you do need to transform something, the `st_transform()` function from the `sf` package is your best bet. 

---

```{r eval=F, message=FALSE, include=T}
options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)
nm_income <- get_acs(
  geography = "tract", 
  variables = "B19013_001", 
  state = "NM", 
  year = 2020, 
  geometry = T
  )

# check the line "geodetic CRS" 
nm_income
st_crs(nm_income)

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = nm_income)

land_grants <- st_read("data/NM_grant_lands/nm_grant_lands.shp", quiet = T)

# check the line "geodetic CRS" 
land_grants
st_crs(land_grants)

```

# Beyond Visualization 

- There are a lot of potential uses for geospatial data in R beyond visualization that I don't have time for here. 

- You might be familiar with other tools like ArcGIS or QGIS that are more point-and-click style software for spatial analyses. 

- However, R's specific strengths are the ability to <i> automate </i> and <i> reproduce </i> computational operations within a single interface where you are also performing other tasks such as visualization.<sup>3</sup>

# Why spatial data? 

- Campante and Do (2014), American Economic Review: Are more isolated capital cities less accountable to the public, thus resulting in higher levels of corruption?

  - Avg. Log Distance variable: "the average of the log of the distance of the state’s population to the capital city" (p. 2459)

- Other ideas?

- Of note is that typically calculating *distance* versus *travel time* requires two different processes. I will cover distance here, but you can see more on [travel time at this resource](https://walker-data.com/census-r/spatial-analysis-with-us-census-data.html#distance-and-proximity-analysis).

## How are historical land grant sites related to present-day distribution of wealth in latecomer territorial states? 

---
```{r include = T, eval= F, message=F}

sf_use_s2(FALSE)

nm_dist_mat <- nm_income %>%
  # get centroids of all census tracts in NM 
  st_centroid() %>%
  # compute distance from land grant sites 
  st_distance(land_grants) 

# look at the matrix 
nm_dist_mat[1:10, 1:10]

# now compute the mean distance in km 
mean_dist <- data.frame(mean_dist = nm_dist_mat %>%
  apply(1, mean) %>%
  as.vector() %>%
  magrittr::divide_by(1000))

# and look at the histogram of these values 
ggplot(min_dist, aes(x= min_dist)) + 
  geom_histogram()

```

What's the unit of analysis here? 

---
# Exercise 2 

1) Make sure you have both the NM census data and the land grant data. 

2) Compute and filter the census data to only include tracts in the top 25 percentile of income (the variable name is `estimate`). 

3) Compute a distance matrix and then create a vector of *minimum* distances. (HINT: change the function in your `apply()` command.)

4) View a histogram of these minimum distances. 

---
```{r include = T, eval= F, message=F}
nm_income %>%
  filter(estimate >=  quantile(nm_income$estimate, na.rm = T)[4])-> upper_25

ggplot(upper_25) + 
  geom_sf()

sf_use_s2(FALSE)

upper25_dist_mat <- upper_25 %>%
  # get centroids of all census tracts in NM 
  st_centroid() %>%
  # compute distance from land grant sites 
  st_distance(land_grants) 

# look at the matrix 
upper25_dist_mat[1:10, 1:10]

# now compute the mean distance in km 
min_dist <- upper25_dist_mat %>%
                         apply(1, min) %>%
                         as.vector() %>%
                         magrittr::divide_by(1000)


upper_25 <- cbind(upper_25, min_dist)

# and look at the histogram of these values 
ggplot(upper_25, aes(x= min_dist)) + 
  geom_histogram()

ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = upper_25, aes(fill = min_dist)) + 
  geom_sf(data = land_grants)
